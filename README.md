# Yaar - Yet Another Auror Rewrite

AurorOS never was perfect and the code always was a spaghetti. Yaar tries to organize all of that mess and to make somewhat usable Auror-base code. It uses AurorOS's branding, but there is now no plans to merge this into the original https://github.com/Interpuce/AurorOS repository.

If I were you, I would recommend not using this piece of art for daily art - even Windows has problems with stability and this will probably have 100x more before merging into AurorOS (if that situation is going to even happen).

Yaar is maintained by [Gorciu](https://github.com/gorciu-official), one of the original AurorOS code creators.
